To find out if a number is odd or even using STM32 Discovery board.

The first step is to install all the packages and drivers needed for the STM32 F4 Discovery board.
This can be done using pack installer.
Next,we can assign the input values from the keyboard/sensor to GPIO pins.
The output can be seen from the LED. If it blinks, the input is odd else even.
For debugging, in keil we have to change the configuration of Flash tools and select debug option as the ULINK2/ME cortex Debugger.
